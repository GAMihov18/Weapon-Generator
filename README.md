Welcome to the main .md file that this project has. You will find all sorts of info here. 
###### It has very limited info still, unfortunately.

## Weapon mechanics
### Weapon logic
Weapons here can have 2 damage types at once, one physical and one magical. If a weapon's main damage type is physical, it deals great physical damage and very low magical damage.

### Here are the physical and elemental damage characteristics:
Each of these damage types have their own thing that is unique to them.

### Main damage types:

Physical
- Piercing
- Slashing
- Blunt

Magical
- Fire
- Earth
- Air
- Water
- Void
- Lux
